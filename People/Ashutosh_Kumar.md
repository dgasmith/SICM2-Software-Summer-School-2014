#### Key for defining level of programming proficiency (DO NOT INCLUDE THIS SECTION IN YOUR FINAL DOCUMENT)

 - Beginner: You have little or no experience with the language. You can write basic programs and understand (more-or-less) code written by others.
 - Intermediate: You have a fair amount of experience with the language. You can write basic and moderately complex programs and you don't consult references/manuals that often.
 - Advanced: You are proficient in the usage of a wide array of the language's built-in features and functionalities. You can write complex programs and you consult references for only the most esoteric commands or functions. You have probably been writting programs in this language for a few years or more.
 - Expert: You know so much about this language that you could (and probably do) teach it to others. You could write books about this language. If someone asks, "How much do you know about [language]?" you respond, "I was born knowing [language]."
